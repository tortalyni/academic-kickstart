I recently graduated with an MA in Sociology, concentrating in Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) at the University of Victoria. During my program and through my work as a teaching assistant and research assistant, I gained experience managing large datasets, writing and reviewing papers, planning conferences, and working on projects independently and as a team. Outside of academia, I spent many years in digital marketing and project management. I am technologically proficient and am a quick learner. I have also worked as an English tutor, creating lesson plans and helping students K-12 with grammar, writing, and more.
