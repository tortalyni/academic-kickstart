I recently graduated with her MA in Sociology, concentrating in Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) at the University of Victoria. During my program and through my work as both a teaching assistant and research assistant, I have had the opportunity to develop my skills as a researcher in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. I have experience managing large datasets, human research ethics, and working independently and as a team on research projects. Taking on a temporary role as an event coordinator at the ETCL, I have also learned how to manage large projects, including developing information management systems and conducting professional communications across institutions and to a global audience. 

Outside of academia, I spent many years in digital marketing, working with programs including Hootsuite, WordPress, Trello, GSuite, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and more. I am technologically proficient and am a quick learner of new programs. I have also worked as an English tutor, creating lesson plans and helping students K-12 with grammar, writing, and more.
